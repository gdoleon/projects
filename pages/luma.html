            <br>
            <p>Luma was developed by Entia Ltd as a home point-of-care device and platform that empowers users suffering from  anaemia that can have multiple causes. It provides a clear picture of their haemoglobin levels over time which allows them to make decisions that can positively affect their condition. The research and development was owned and conducted by Entia's internal design and engineering departments.

            <h4>Co-Design</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Co-design is a process used in product development that introduces the user as an active participant in ideation and research sessions. The co-design process is iterative, meaning that each new stage builds on what was learned in the previous session.<br><br>During the study participants guided and contributed to ideas, concepts and prototypes through answering questionnaires, attending focus groups and participating in different workshops. Workshops had a more hands-on approach, where the user was introduced to the design process and asked to put words and ideas into drawings and prototypes that helped them express their subconscious needs.</p>

              <p>The different stages of the co-design sessions with users brought into play the diverse aspects of product development. Users followed a plan and engaged topics such as; onboarding, user interface. These sessions allowed us to create a comprehensive map of anaemia and who the sufferers were. We learned that a big portion of these affected users were women, this new learning allowed us to change the scope and focus on female users. Brand and packaging aspects were introduced strategically as they progressed through the stages of development. They were able to engage with these topics and we assisted them at providing unbiased feedback.</p>

            <p>The user experience went through a series of iterations with the users. We used design research methods to uncover real needs and proceed to materialise these into features that then were prioritised and presented to them through different tangible designs.<br><br>Journeys and flows were created to depict the entire user experience. We used a diverse set of tools to bring these concepts to life, these tools ranged from low fidelity UI flows and paper prototypes to click-through digital interfaces and high fidelity UI prototypes.</p>

            <p>Luma was a Bluetooth free device, which meant that the user wask asked to upload the tests manually every so often. The import feature inside the app was able to upload a batch of results and distinguish between new and duplicates.<br><br>The app could also identify if a different user (with a different device) was attempting to upload their results to the app. In this case the app offered the user the option to skip the tests that didn't match their profile or to replace their results history with the new user information.<br><br>The way the device connected and retrieved results from the device was through the use of QR codes. The device would produce a QR code after each test and prompt the user to scan it with their app. This QR code would contain the latest result and also include the previous history of results in case the user had forgotten or skipped uploading their results previously.<br><br>We wanted to have an on screen tutorial that was overlayed on top of the camera view. This way, the user would have a quick reminder on how to align the QR code with the phone camera.</p>

            <p>It was important for the user to be able to visualise their journey through improvement. Treatment for haemoglobin deficiency can last for several months which meant that users don't immediately see improvements in their blood levels.<br><br>Because of this, users didn't have to test on a daily basis, but testing often was encouraged in order to build a more precise trend over time. Switching between time scales allowed the user to visualise their results trend over time and identified moments where improvement began taking effect. Through testing we found that a month and a year time scales were the right size.<br><br>Through the onboarding process we could collect the right information in order to display the right reference range for each user. Through testing and iteration we made sure to use the right wording for the reference range and validated that users had a clear understanding of it.</p>

            <p>We learned that the journey into improving haemoglobin levels was a lengthy process and it often meant changing medication or dosage. Through prototyping we discovered that users saw benefit from being able to annotate their results with their current medication.<br><br>Through the medication journal users were able to create a new medication and specify strength, dosage and frequency. These medications were recorded in a medication library that allowed the user to pick from a list of already created medications if they needed to do so. We also discovered that there was the need to link this feature with a simple reminder which they could create, activate or deactivate themselves from the reminders section of the app. The reminders section would automatically read all previously created medications and allow the user to choose any of them or create a new one.</p>

            <p>With low haemoglobin came a series of symptoms and side effects. As a part of tracking improvement in blood levels and medication, symptoms tracking was also important for users as symptoms and side effects were a result of blood levels and use of medication.<br><br>We implemented this journal by having a simple slider that users could interact with to set the severity of their symptoms. Severity levels went from none, mild, moderate to severe. We also implemented a notes box field at the bottom of the page for users to record any relevant information.</p>

            <p>Our research also pointed out that one of the reasons for women having low haemoglobin could be linked to heavy periods. Period tracking was included among the things that are tracked and supervised by clinicians among cases of low haemoglobin and iron is menstruation.<br><br>The app had the aim of being a supporting tool for users that go through the journey of recovering from low haemoglobin. Users could  use the app to support the evolution of their recovery with their GPs. The period journal within the app was a simple implementation that allowed the user to attach data related to the severity of their periods to their overall results, symptoms and medication. This way we could offer a comprehensive view on their improvement and help them make the right lifestyle decisions.</p>
