            <br>
            <p>As a mission, the project aimed to improve the quality of life of immunocompromised cancer patients.<br><br>Using technology developed by Entia we set the aim of designing a testing platform that could allow patients to be monitored from home, reducing the time spent in waiting rooms and also the risks that come with exposing themselves to crowds and spaces.<br><br>Cancer affects people disregarding age or sex, for that reason our sample of users had a diverse demographic. We focused at designing inclusively, paying attention at having elderly patients present throughout our studies allowed us to design a system that could be adopted by most users.</p>

            <br>
            <p>We structured the discovery phase to be a collaborative process between every stakeholder involved.<br><br>The research sessions and focus groups were designed in a way that allowed each stakeholder to bring their own view and experience on what the challenges were. We ran mixed sessions were doctors would seat next to patients and nurses and other independent sessions with each stakeholder. These sessions were conducted at partner hospitals across London and included cancer patients, carers, nurses, doctors and consultants.</p>

The platform needed to allow the patient to perform a blood test from home using a finger prick. The blood sample would then be analysed by the device and the results sent to the hospital wirelessly. This early scenario allowed us to look at the different touch points across the user journey and speculate on the different ways we could tackle each identified challenge.</p>

We had foreseen these issues and established a close connection with a partner hospital in Manchester and recruited health professionals into our research team to help us with the different phases of the study.<br><br>Nevertheless, we also needed to reach patients at home and be able to talk to them in a non-clinical environment. The consequent tests were conducted as online interviews, and for these we shipped all the equipment needed (cameras, props and models) to patients in England and Wales.</p>

              <p>At this stage we had gone through a series of collaborative sessions with design engineers to understand the possibilities and limitations of the internal hardware architecture. Doing this allowed us to start sketching out concepts having feasible layouts in mind.</p>

            <p>Integration with the blood container took place in parallel to prototyping these enclosure concepts. Emphasis was made on the ergonomics and human factors of loading the container into the device.<br><br>We had a clear set of recorded user needs that specified the container to be handled in any direction and to be left and right hand agnostic. Through testing we were able to identify the set of parameters that affected usability and kept them as considerations when looking at the blood container-device interface design for manufacturing. .</p>

              <p>The different phases of testing allowed us to refine the concepts and incorporate usability learnings into the final design. Having the hardware architecture and core UX defined we could move into working with detailing and finishes specifications with manufacturers. The design for manufacturing phase focused on getting all parts of the enclosure to a good design stage for injection moulding.</p>

            <p>Due to pressure on the project deadlines and delays in some parts of manufacturing supplies globally some compromises had to be taken to be able to meet deadlines.<br><br>This meant the device couldn't reach its final design specs but minor changes had to be made that didn't impact core UX. These delays mostly affected the procurement of internal electrical components including the bespoke screen which meant that the device ended up gaining a few millimetres in overall height and the use of an readily available OTS screen.</p>
