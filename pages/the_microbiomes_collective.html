            <br>
            <p>The Microbiome is the community of microorganisms that belong to a particular
              environment, inside and outside of our bodies. They surround the spaces we
              inhabit.<br><br>The presence of microorganisms in these microbiomes have both beneficial andadverse effects on our physical health. The accelerated growth of big cities is altering the natural balance of these microbiomes, transforming cities into potentially hostile habitats. How would you navigate the city every day knowing the biological impact that different spaces have on our bodies?<br><br>The Microbiome Collective is a speculative platform that makes visible the biological connection we have with spaces. Through the use of a handheld device and a mobile application, it visualises how our movement through the city influences our health by displaying normally unseen microbiomes. This platform suggests a different way of seeing urban spaces, opening possibilities for exploration and access to our personal health.</p>

            <p>This phase of the MA program was structured in four directions. These design directions were: design for enterprise, design for public systems, service design, and design for discourse. Students were asked to focus on one of these four different directions as a foundation for their projects. The method used throughout the development of the thesis project encouraged self-directed research backed up by professional mentoring and studio reviews.</p><br><br>
            <h4>Speculative Critical Design</h4>
            <br>
            <p>My engagement with discursive methods through previous work within the MA program shaped the direction of my project from early stages. I realised that this channel could allow me to address a near future scenario (Taxonomy of Futures, Dunne & Raby) where present technology could be pushed to tackle growing environmental concerns and open new ways of interfacing with our environment.</p>

            <p>How would a device like this be used within the context of urban life? And how could you display all this information to the user? Although very broad, these thought exercises started directing me to the construction of a visual language and framework for the service. An important aspect of these stories was that through this technology I was empowering the users to read their environment in different ways.<br><br>Part of the concept at this stage aimed to design a modular system that allowed you to have different intensities of monitoring and offered flexibility in its use. However, these directions required a high understanding of gene sequencing technologies for the proper functioning of the device.</p>

        <h4>Technical Feasibility</h4>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>Through the research phase of the project I came across a series of technologies and research papers that studied and speculated about the feasibility of miniaturising sequencing technologies. A company called Oxford Nanopore Technologies had already developed the smallest DNA and RNA sequencer devices ever created. These devices offer almost real-time data of DNA and RNA molecules. These are devices that exist today and have a smaller form factor than a smartphone. This led me to believe that in the near future and with further development this technology could be iterated, improved and miniaturised more giving birth to a new range of sequencing devices.</p>

The more harmful organisms the user finds the more indicator will alter its shape.<br><br>The bacterial score is a synthesis of the balance of the organisms the users have found. An algorithm processes these findings with online data to establish a score that represents the balance of the user’s health.<br><br>The assistant acts as an artificial intelligent bot that crosses data gathered by different users across the city, to suggest activities that can improve the user’s bacterial score.</p>

This mode would trigger the sampling device and pop up a "scanning" animation for the duration of the sampling. I thought it was important to visually show the user what was happening during the sampling scanning.<br><br>For the animation I took inspiration from particles moving in the air and agglomerating together, in the centre of the screen, as a way of showing them being captured by the device.</p>
