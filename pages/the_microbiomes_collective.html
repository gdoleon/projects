            <br>
            <p>The Microbiome is the community of microorganisms that belong to a particular
              environment, inside and outside of our bodies. They surround the spaces we
              inhabit.
              <br><br>
              The presence of microorganisms in these microbiomes have both benefitial and
              adverse influence on our physical health. The accelerated growth of big cities is altering the natural balance of these microbiomes, transfroming cities into potentially hostile habitats. How would you navigate the city every day knowing the biological impact that different spaces have on our bodies?
              <br><br>
              The Microbiome Collective is a speculative platform that makes visible the biological connection we have with spaces. Through the use of a handheld device and a mobile application, it visualises how our movement through the city influences our health by displaying normally unseen microbiomes. This platform suggests a different way of seeing our urban spaces, opening possibilities of exploration and unlocking the access to our personal health.</p>

            <p>This phase of the MA program was structured in four pillars. These pillars were the different directions that design could take; design for enterprise, design for public systems, service design, and design for discourse. Students were asked to focus on one of these four different directions to base their thesis project on. The method used throughout the develpment of the thesis project encouraged self-directed research backed up by professional mentoring and studio reviews.</p>

      <p>The project proposed a crowd-sourced platform for the exploration of the microbial world. It was directed to citizen scientists, in other words, curious citizens willing to learn and understand through science how everyday activities affect our bodies and behaviours. This group of citizens included people that were willing to collaborate towards the expansion of scientific knowledge.<br><br>Looking at the advancement in sequencing technologies and the miniaturization of laboratory equipment as the basis of the project, this platform proposed a cloud infrastructure that could process samples of different materials collected by users to then respond through an interface that indicated the types of organisms they had found, where they were located and how they were related to their health. </p>

        <h4>Technical Feasibility</h4>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>Among all the research undertaken in this project I came across a series of technologies and research papers that studied and speculated about the feasibility of miniaturizing sequencing technologies. To my surprise, an English company called Oxford Nanopore Technologies had already developed the smallest DNA and RNA sequencer devices ever created. These devices offer almost real-time data of DNA and RNA molecules. These are devices that exist today and have a smaller form factor than a smartphone.

This mode would trigger the sampling device and pop up a "scanning" animation for the duration of the sampling.
