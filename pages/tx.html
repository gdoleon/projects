            <h4>Description</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Primary conceptual stage of an electric vehicle for city commuting in Lima, Peru. This project was developed for Gruas Triple A as a first step towards improving transportation in the outskirts of the city, envisioning a more secure and efficient compact vehicle that fits within the cultural and technological reality of Lima. It build on the concept of mototaxis, a three wheeled vehicle, also known as rickshaw in some parts of Europe and Asia. This vehicle can be found all around Latin America.</p>

            <p>37 of the 49 districts in Lima have authorised the circulation of mototaxis but only 48% of these vehicles in the streets have the required documentation. <br><br>These vehicles are only meant to connect the outer areas of the city, where public transportation has not yet been properly implemented, with main avenues and transportation routes, but nowadays they even circulate the most transited and congested streets in the centre of the city.<br><br>Most of the districts where the circulation of these vehicles is authorised are emitting permissions without having technical regulations or making a proper study of whatâ€™s the maximum amount of units needed per district. This lack of regulation together with the recent introduction of cheaper Chinese components to the country have given place to the creation of informal assembly lines where these vehicles have no technical regulations and which construction is often improvised.<br><br>It is also important to mention that mototaxi rides take 4.8% of the transportation systems in Lima and they are responsible for 10% of all accidents.</p>

        <h4>Assembly</h4>
        <br>
        <p>I began researching the structure and components of existing mototaxis such as wheelbase, track dimensions, wheel diameters, combustion engines, fork steering (offset and trail), spring and hydropneumatic suspension, chassis materials and structure.<br><br>Then I proceeded to study the actual fabrication origin of these vehicles to which I found two main streams of commercialization. The stream were chinese and national companies that sold already assembled mototaxis in specialised stores. The second stream were Chinese companies that sold assembly kits, these kits included only the main mechanical components: motor and  frame, front and back wheels, as well as headlights and backlights.<br><br>I found that it was very common to buy this kit and then take it to an informal assembly workshop where each owner decides the dimensions of the vehicle and the materials used which are usually composed of a metallic tube structure and a body of fibreglass with vinyl plastic applications.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Problems Found</h4>
        <br>
        <ul class="bulleted">
          <li>
            <p>The informal assembly industry is creating vehicles that are not prepared for circulation endangering the passenger safety and often incurring in fatal accidents.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Improvised vehicles do not offer the necessary performance.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Lack of regulation is causing these vehicles to grow in number and begin to congest main avenues creating disorder and threatening pedestrian safety.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Needs</h4>
        <br>
        <p><span class="bold">Terrein:</span><br>The vehicle must be able to withstand various types of terrains and maintain its stability where roads are still unpaved and where they are affected by both heavy traffic load, and bad weather conditions such as frequent rains.</p>

        <p>I used SolidWorks to build the interior and exterior of the vehicle. Starting with the basic proportions of the interior and then working with real scale dimensions to further refine the anthropometry. I went through various iterations on the exterior lines and surfaces in order to accentuate the feeling of speed, lightness and compactness. After reviewing the design with the client and with material and mechanical engineers at UNITRADE, a rotational moulding plastic factory, I proceeded to refine the remaining aspects of the vehicle.</p>

          <p>The back of the vehicle has a cargo space with an approximate volume of 240l. The space below the trunk is where the engine is located, moving the engine back helps improve the stability.</p>
